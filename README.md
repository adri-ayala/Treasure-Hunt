# Treasure-Hunt

## Project Overview

This project involves developing an intelligent agent for a Treasure Hunt Game using Deep Q-Learning. The agent, a pirate, must navigate an maze to locate the treasure and avoid encountering obstacles. The maze environment is modeled using Python, and reinforcement learning is used to train the agent for optimal navigation.


### Provided Code

- **Environment & Game Mechanics**: The project included predefined Python classes:
  - `TreasureMaze.py`: Defines the maze structure and gameplay mechanics.
  - `GameExperience.py`: Manages memory for reinforcement learning episodes.
- **Notebook & Visualization**: A Jupyter Notebook was provided to execute and visualize the game environment, including helper functions for rendering the maze.

### Developed Code

- **Deep Q-Learning Implementation**:
  - Implemented the reinforcement learning agent using a neural network.
  - Designed the training loop, including experience replay and epsilon-greedy strategy.
  - Adjusted hyperparameters for optimized learning.
- **Performance Evaluation**:
  - Developed functions to test model efficiency and track performance across training epochs.
  - Tuned the reward structure to improve decision-making by the pirate agent.

## Learning Reflections

### Connection to Computer Science

This project illustrates key concepts in artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning, demonstrating how intelligent agents can learn from interactions with an environment. By using neural networks and deep learning techniques, I explored ways to improve decision-making in a dynamic environment.

### Problem-Solving as a Computer Scientist

Approaching this problem required:

- **Understanding the Environment**: Analyzing how the maze structure affects navigation.
- **Designing a Learning Strategy**: Implementing Q-learning with a reward system.
- **Iterative Optimization**: Refining hyperparameters and adjusting network architecture for better performance.

### Ethical Responsibilities

We must ensure that AI agents are trained fairly and do not reinforce unintended biases. In practical applications, it is crucial to:

- **Responsible AI Design**: Transparency in decision-making processes.
- **Consider End-User Impact**: Develop AI models that optimize user experience and safety.
- **Promote Accountability**: Document decision logic and provide means for oversight in critical applications.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into reinforcement learning and AI-driven decision-making. By implementing and optimizing deep Q-learning, we reinforced concepts in machine learning while building an engaging and interactive game environment. The experience highlights the importance model evaluation and iterative refinement in AI development.
